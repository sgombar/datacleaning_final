#Final Submission
sgombar's submission for Coursera Data Clean Project

# Requirements
I am assuming that run_analysis.R is in the same folder as the main items from the Samsung data...ie features.txt, features_info.txt

# Variables
The two main variables at the end will be 'data' and 'subject_activity'. 'Data' is a data frame that has all the mean/std items from X_values in test and train with appropriate labels from features plus info on the activity and subject they were generated from. 'subject_activity' is also a data frame but with rows corresponding to a subject and an activity.  So 1_Walking is the average for each variable for subject 1 and activity walking.
