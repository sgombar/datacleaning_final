#Final Submission
sgombar's submission for Coursera Data Clean Project

# Requirements
I am assuming that run_analysis.R is in the same folder as the main items from the Samsung data...ie features.txt, features_info.txt

# Criteria
1- The submitted data set is tidy.
2- The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3- GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4- The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

# Variables
The two main variables at the end will be 'data' and 'subject' and 'activity'. 'Data' is a data frame that has all the mean/std items from X_values in test and train with appropriate labels from features plus info on the activity and subject they were generated from. 'subject' 'activity' is also a data frame but with rows corresponding to a subject and an activity performed while measurments were made.
